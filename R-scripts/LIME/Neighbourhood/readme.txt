In order to reproduce the findings of the analysis one can proceed in different ways.
This is because run times are incredibly long for some scripts.
Thus, I do not recommend to re-compute my findings.
However if you wish to, do the following:

Before compiling my chapter, run the complete R script "R-scripts/LIME/Neighbourhood/source_script.R" as it is.
This script sources all necessary other scripts in the correct order. 

If you only want to rebuild my figures just use my already-computed results and only run the R scripts utils.R and packages.R.
