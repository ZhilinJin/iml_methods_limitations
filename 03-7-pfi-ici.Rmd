# Partial and Individual Permutation Feature Importance

*Author: Moritz Wagner*


1) Introduce the main limitation of PFI which will be solved in this chapter
2) Why is it interesting
3) What are the concepts I will focus on in the following (PI plots and ICI plots)
4) Why convenient choice? Nice way to visualize => provides a good overview 

As already discussed, the concept of Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) depicts a strong tool to determine, if some assumptions hold, to what extent a feature contributes to the predicitive power of a model. However, the single metric is rather poor when aiming for a deepened understanding of Feature Importance. 

Here: name so arguments for why it would be nice to assess the feature importance over ...

Then: 


## Theoretical Framework

theortical formular

algorithm for  PI and ICI 


## Simulation and Real Life Data


## Discussion and Implementation of New Concepts

Reason for discussion: 
as it is a rather easy complement of the so far considered ICI plots with a different angle/perspective.
BUT: not clear so far to what extent that delivers indeed new insights.
  Maybe Boston Housing: predictor age?
dICI plots and c-ICI (centered ICI plots)

d-ICI: when the curves have a wide range of intercepts .. then hard to detect any heterogeneity in the Feature Importance..
Question: Is this the same problem for Feature Importance or is this canceled out?
