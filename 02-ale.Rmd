# Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) 




## Motivation

As seen in section 2 PDPs don't work well as soon as two or more features are correlated. This gives rise to the definition of ALEs. Although their definition makes sense for high dimensional feature spaces including categorical features, within this section we only treat a space with two continous features. 

## The Theoretical Formula 

The uncentered ALE with respect to a starting point $z_{0, j}$ is defined as
$$  \widetilde{ALE}_{\hat{f},~j}(x) = \hat{f}_{x_j,ALE}(x) = \int_{z_{0,~j}}^{x} E_{X_c \mid X_j} [\hat{f}^j(X_j,~X_c)\mid X_j = z_j]~dz_j,$$
where $\hat{f}$ is an arbitrary prediction function on the featurespace $X = (X_j,X_c)$ (with feature of interest $X_j$ and other features $X_c$) as well as its j-th partial derivative $\hat{f}^j(*,*)$.

### Centering

The ALE (centered ALE) is defined as

$$  ALE_{\hat{f},~j}(x) = \widetilde{ALE}_{\hat{f},~j}(x) - E_{X_j}[\widetilde{ALE}_{\hat{f},~j}(X_j)]$$ 

TODO: where do we explain why we center and interpret the centering?


## Estimation Formula 

Since this theoretical formula of no use for a blackbox model with unknown or even non existing gradients, an approximative approach will be used.
The uncentered ALE can be approximated by the formula 

$$ \widehat{\widetilde{ALE}_{\hat{f},j}}(x) = \int_{z_{0,j}}^{x} \sum_{k=1}^{K}   1_{]z_{k-1,~j},~z_{k,~j}]}(x_j) ~ \frac{1}{n_j(k)}\sum_{i:x_j^{(i)}\in N_j(k)} \frac{[\hat{f}(z_{k,j}, x_{\setminus j}^{(i)})-\hat{f}(z_{k-1,j}, x_{\setminus j}^{(i)})]}{z_{k,~j}-z_{k-1,~j}}~dx_j~.  $$

In a first step the relevant dimension of the feature space is divided into K intervals beginning with the starting point $z_{0, j}$. As it is not clear how to exactly divide the feature space, section 3.x deals with that question. The upper border of the k-th interval is denoted by $z_{k, ~j}$ as well as the lower border by $z_{k-1, ~j}$. $N_j(k)$ denotes the k-th interval and $n_j(k)$ the total number of observations having the j-value within this interval. $x_j^{(i)}$ is the j-value of the i-th observation and correspondingly $x_{\setminus j}^{(i)}$ the values of the other features. The term on the right approximates the expected partial derivative within each interval. 
Therefore each instance within an interval is shifted to the upper and lower bounds of the interval and the total difference of the prediction is calculated. Devided by the length of the interval this is a reasonable approximation for the "local" effect on the prediction if the feature of interest changes (cet. par.).
By averaging these approximations over all observations within the k-th interval, we recieve a rough estimator for the term $E_{X_c \mid X_j} [\hat{f}^j(X_j,~X_c)\mid X_j \in N_j(k)]$, which we take as constant effect for the k-th interval. 
By integrating over this step function which represents the locally estimated derivatives, the (local) changes are accumulated. Thats why the name Accumulated Local Effects is quite reasonable.
This leads directly to the following approximative formula for the centered ALE
$$   \widehat{ALE_{\hat{f},~j}}(x) = \widehat{\widetilde{ALE}_{\hat{f},~j}}(x) - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \widehat{\widetilde{ALE}_{\hat{f},~j}}(x_j^{(i)})~. 
 $$


### Implementation Formula

As both the centered and the uncentered ALE estimations are piecewise linear functions (integration over a step function), one can first calculate the ALE at the interval boundaries and interpolate in a second step. Therefore the folowing formula proposed by Apley with slightly changed notation will be useful:

$$  \widehat{\widetilde{ALE}}_{steps, \hat{f},j}(x) =  \sum_{k=1}^{k(x)}   \frac{1}{n_j(k)}\sum_{i:x_j^{(i)}\in N_j(k)} [\hat{f}(z_{k,j}, x_{\setminus j}^{(i)})-\hat{f}(z_{k-1,j}, x_{\setminus j}^{(i)})].  $$
This formula also returns a step function, but the values in each interval are the accumulated values of the averaged total differences in each interval.

<!-- choose one -->
Two sentences: 
To transfer this formula to the correct estimator of the uncentered ALE one has to linearely interpolate the beginning of each interval with the last value of this estimation formula in this interval. So to start it one connects the point $(0,z_{0, j})$ with $(\widehat{\widetilde{ALE}}_{steps, \hat{f},j}(z_{0, j}), z_{1, j})$ and this point with $(\widehat{\widetilde{ALE}}_{steps, \hat{f},j}(z_{2, j}), z_{2, j})$ and so on. 

Alternative more mathematically:
To transfer this formula into the correct estimator of the uncentered ALE one has to linearely interpolate the points $(\widehat{\widetilde{ALE}}_{steps, \hat{f},j}(z_{k-1, j}), z_{k-1, j})$ with $(\widehat{\widetilde{ALE}}_{steps, \hat{f},j}(z_{k, j}), z_{k, j})$ for $k \in \{1, ..., K \}$ and $\widehat{\widetilde{ALE}}_{steps, \hat{f},j}(z_{0, j}) = 0$.
<!-- choose one -->

Since in this formula there is no integral, it is easier to implement.



## Intuition, Interpretation and 

As the former sections introduced the theoretical basics for the ALE, this section shall provide the reader with an intuition as well for the calculation method as for the interpretation. As described above, the local behaviour of the model with respect to the variable of interest is estimated by moving the existing data points to the boundaries of their interval and evaluating the total difference of the prediction for the "new" datapoints. Figure 2.1 gives a good intuition for this procedure. 


```{r, fig.cap='(ref:aleIntuition)', echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/ale_estimation_intuition.PNG")
```
(ref:aleIntuition) bla bla total differences

TODO: explain it


As the evaluation is done on relatively small intervals, on the one hand the local behaviour of the model is estimated. On the other hand the covariance structure of the features is taken into account, as only "realistic" datapoints are simulated.

For figure (TODO: reference) 2.1 an ALE could look like this:

```{r, fig.cap='(ref:aleExample)', echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/ale_example.PNG")
```
(ref:aleExample) bla bla interpretation of ALE bla bla

TODO: interpret it ;-)

Next to this case - one numeric feature of interest - in the next chapter methods and interpretation for ALE with two numeric features or one categorical feature will be looked at in detail. Furthermore we will pay attention to the size of the intervals the data is evaluatet on which can be crucual for the expressiveness of the ALE in some data and learner combinations.
