# Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) Curves

## Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)

The Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) is a rather intuitive and easy-to-understand visualization of the features' impact on the predicted outcome. It maps the marginal effect of the selected variable(s) and can reveal the nature of dependence structure between target and individual feature variable.\citep{Molnar2019}

The underlying function can be described as follows:

Let $x_S$ be the set of features of interest for the PDP and $x_C$ the complement set which contains all other features.
While the general model function $f(x) = f(x_S, x_C)$ depends on all input variables, the partial dependence function marginalizes over the feature distribution in set C:\citep{hastie2013elements}

$$f_{x_S}(x_S) = \mathbb{E}_{x_C}[f(x_S, x_C)]$$


The partial dependence function can be estimated by averaging the actual feature values of $x_C$ in the training data at given values of $x_S$ or, in other words, it computes the marginal effect of $x_S$ on the prediction. In order to derive realistic results, a major assumption of the PDP is that the features in $x_S$ and $x_C$ are independent and thus uncorrelated.\citep{hastie2013elements}

$$\hat{f}_{x_S}(x_S)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_S, x^{(i)}_{C})$$

In classification problems with probability outputs, the partial dependence function is modeled separately for all of the K different classes, i.e. it shows the probability for each respective class at given feature values of $x_S$.\citep{hastie2013elements} For instance, in the plot below it is clear the passengers in 1st class had the highest probability of survival and the 3rd class passengers the lowest.

**Advantages and Limitations of Partial Dependence Plots**

Partial Dependence Plots are easy to compute and a poular way to explain insights from black box Machine Learning models. With their intuitive character, PDPs perfectly qualify for the communication to non-technical audience. However, due to limited visualization techniques and the restriction of human perception to a maximum of three dimensions, only one or two features can reasonably be displayed in one PDP.\citep{Molnar2019}

![FIGURE 3: The two-dimensional PDP for the numerical feature "Age" and the categorical feature "Sex" shows that the survival probability for female passengers strongly differs from male passeners. While for both genders the probability declines as age increases, this decrease is much steeper for males.](images/pdp_2_features_1.jpeg)

![FIGURE 4: The two-dimensional PDP for the numerical features "Age" and "Fare" illustrates that the age range 0-20 has a fairly uniform probability to survive, independent of the fare paid. From age 20 onwards, however, passengers travelling at a lower fare also had a much lower survival probability than those that paid a high fare.](images/pdp_2_features_2.jpeg)


Drawing a PDP with one or two feature variables allows a straight-forward interpretation of the marginal effects. This holds true as long as the features are not correlated. Should this assumption be violated, the partial dependence function will produce unrealistic data points. Furthermore, opposite effects of heterogeneous subgroups might remain hidden through averaging the marginal effects, which could lead to wrong conclusions.\citep{Molnar2019}



## Individual Conditional Expectation Curves
While the partial dependence plots provide the average effect of a feature, the Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots disaggregate this average and plot the functional relationship between the predicted response and the feature for individual instances. Thus, a PDP is the average of the lines of an ICE plot.\citep{Molnar2019}


A formal definition: consider the response function $\hat{f}$, for each instance in ${(x^{(i)}_S, x^{(i)}_C)}^N_{i=1}$, the curve $\hat{f}_S^{(i)}$ is plotted against the observed values of $x^{(i)}_S$, while $x^{(i)}_C$ remains fixed.\citep{Molnar2019}\citep{Goldstein2013}


![FIGURE 5: In ICE plots, each line represents separately one instance and shows what would happen to the model’s prediction if the feature of a particular instance varied, holding all other features the same (c.p.). An ICE plot can highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a feature. This suggests where and to what extent heterogeneities might exist.](images/ice_plot.jpeg)

###Centered ICE Plot###
Heterogeneity in the model can be difficult to distinguish when the curves have a wide range of intercepts and “stacked” on each other. The so called centered ICE plot (c-ICE) is a simple solution which removes level effects. The curves are centered at a certain point in the feature and display only the difference in the prediction to this point. \citep{Molnar2019} After anchoring a location $x^a$ in the range of $x_s$ and connecting all prediction lines at that point, the new curves are defined as:

$$\hat{f}^{(i)}_{cent} = \hat{f^{(i)}} - \mathbf{1}\hat{f}(x^a,x^{(i)}_C)$$
It is recommended that the most interpretable plots occur when the minimum or the maximum observed value is chosen.

![FIGURE 6: In the 0-50 range in the centered plot we see some variation with some individual's survival probalility increasing as the fare goes up, while decreasing for other individuals. After this the curves move more uniform, with very little changes in the 100-350 range. A small uptick in surival probality for all individuals takes place at a fare of roughly 390, before stabilizing for the rest of the range.](images/c_ice_plot.jpeg)


###Derivative ICE Plot###
Another way to explore the heterogeneity is to show plots of the partial derivative
of $\hat{f}$ with respect to $x_s$. Assume that $x_s$ does not interact
with the other predictors in the fitted model, the prediction function can be written as:

$$\hat{f}(x) = \hat{f}(x_s,x_C) = g(x_s) + h(x_C),$$ 

so that $$\frac{\partial{\hat{f}(\mathbf{x})}}{\partial x_s} = g'(x_s)$$

When no interactions are present in the fitted model, all curves in the d-ICE plot are equivalent, and the plot shows a single line. When interactions do exist, the derivative lines will be heterogeneous. As it can be difficult to visually assess derivatives from ICE plots, it is useful to plot an estimate of the partial derivative directly.\citep{Goldstein2013}


###Advantages and Limitations of ICE Plots###
**Advantages**
ICE plots are more intuitive than PDPs and enable data scientists to drill much deeper to explore individual differences and identify subgroups and interactions between model inputs. 

**Disadvantages**
Firstly, only one feature can be plotted in an ICE plot meaningfully. Otherwise, there will be a problem of overplotting and you would see nothing. Secondly, ICE plots have the same problem as PDPs that some data points in the lines might be invalid. Finally, it might be difficult to see to average in ICE plots.\citep{Molnar2019}
